                    Who is the founder, Leo John Dehon? He is a man who, after many adventures, got to the French seminary of Rome to study in order to become a priest. As it must, he brings with him a Parisian student's culture, a vision of his world well sharpened by journeys and notorious studies. He is a stenographer during the first Vatican council and learns to love the Church from the inside. He comes back to his diocese, barded of 4 doctorates and will be named by his bishop 7th Vicar to St. Martin of St.-Quentin Basilica in the Aisne.
                    <br />
                    At the contact of the social environment and the work world of that time, he develops a sensitivity with regard to all poverties. He discovers his passion for God and wants to put it to the service of the Church by living his religious life and promoting it. He is surprised by the little interest for the individuals in a world of which the Church has still difficulties to grasp the issues. He will say: "Leave the vestries, go to the people." Some companions will join him and this will be the birth of the Congregation. Like most non-profit organisations, it will overcome difficult moments, but isn't this the guarantee to have a future? More than spirituality, our founder left us "an art of living". Every religious man is called to put Christ's "soft and humble of heart" in the centre of his life, in his presence with the people or in the world of work. God loves our world and wishes that Love be with everyman, should he be disfigured, as he is not less God's son. "He is seized by this unknown love, to which he wants to answer by an intimate union to the Heart of Christ, and by the establishment of  its kingdom in souls and in society."
